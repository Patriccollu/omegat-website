Java. It is a tool intended for professional translators. It does not
translate for you! (Software that does this is called "machine

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>System Requirements</h3>
        <p>OmegaT will run on any system on which the JRE (Java Runtime
Environment) has been or can be installed. The JRE is now supplied with
OmegaT and need not be obtained separately. OmegaT has been successfully
installed on Windows (all versions from 98 onwards), Macintosh OS X and
Linux.</p>
        <p>Files in Microsoft Office XML format can be translated directly in
OmegaT. Files in older MS Word, Excel and Powerpoint formats can be
translated following conversion to the equivalent current Microsoft
Office formats, or alternatively to the Office Open XML format, which can
be done in OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice (also free). To obtain
OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice, follow the link from "Third-party
software" button on the left.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>User Requirements</h3>
        <p>OmegaT is not particularly difficult to install or use, but it
    does require a willingness to read and follow the instructions. If
    you have a natural aversion to reading instructions, and your
    approach to new software is to click on every button you see until
    something resembling the desired effect occurs, then OmegaT is
    probably not suitable for you.</p>

    <h2>The OmegaT project and you</h2>
    <div class="header-line">
      <!---->
    </div>
    <p>OmegaT isn't just a product; it's an exciting project, and you can be
part of it.</p>
    <p>OmegaT is free software. That means that users like you are free to
download and use it with very little in the way of restrictions. You are
also free to copy it and pass it on to other people.</p>
    <p>OmegaT is open-source software. That means that if you feel so
inclined, you may modify OmegaT to suit your own requirements. For
advocates of open-source software, this freedom is even more important
than the exemption from having to pay anything.</p>
    <p>The OmegaT project would benefit from greater support from volunteers
in almost all areas. Although many users are aware of this, their
reaction is often "But I can't program!". Programming is certainly the
most important function, and without programming, there is no program.
But programming isn't the only job needing to be done. Below is a list of
areas for which further volunteers would be more than welcome!</p>

        <h3>Documentation authoring</h3>
        <p>Documentation is very important. Many of you reading this will be
    translators who have translated a lot of user documentation. Have you
    considered writing some user documentation yourself? It's a real
    eye-opener!</p>

        </span>
        <h3>Localization</h3>
        <p>Thanks to the work of translators in the past, OmegaT's user
    interface and/or Help texts have been translated into several
    languages. That means there are only a few thousand left! Localizing
    OmegaT into other languages is also an ongoing task, since new
    features and functions are being added all the time. See the
    <a href="#">Localizing OmegaT HowTo</a> for details of what is involved in
    localizing/translating OmegaT.</p>

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>One of the most useful things OmegaT users can do is... to use
    OmegaT. And when they find things that don't work, or deficiencies in
    the documentation, to tell us about them.</p>

    OmegaT?</p>

    gratitude by making a donation, go to the OmegaT SourceForge page and

        <h3>Programming (Java)</h3>
        <p>OmegaT is written in Java. If you're a programmer and you happen
    to know Java, please check the documentation in the source code under
    /docs_devel for information on how to get started.</p>

        <h3>Programming (not Java)</h3>
        <p>If you can program in another language, you can write code to
    support the core application. Such auxiliary code has already been
    written in Star Basic and Tcl/Tk, for instance.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-12">
          <p>But I can't program at all, I hear you say. Well, have you
    considered learning? If you are already reasonably familiar with
    computers in general and choose a straightforward scripting language
    like Tcl/Tk, you could teach yourself enough to be able to write
    simple but useful scripts within just a couple of weeks. Continuing
    Professional Development is the current buzzword!</p>
