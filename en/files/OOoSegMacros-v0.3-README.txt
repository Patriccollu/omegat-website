These OpenOffice.org (OOo) macros will allow you to segment a text to a sentence level instead of paragraphs.
It is meant to prepare text for translation with the OmegaT CAT if you prefer sentence segmentation.

WHAT'S NEW IN V. 0.3
  New macro to combine both segmentation rules for both 1 and 2 spaces after punctuation (this is for messy texts mixing
       both styles)
  Better looking code.

KNOWN PROBLEM: it seems a bug in the search replace feature
  of OpenOffice v. 1.0.1 generates an error.
  Please use with v. 1.1.0 or above.

SETUP:
  a - in OpenOffice.org, Tools menu > Macros > Macro.
  b - select or create a module (default is Module1, just as good as any), and click Edit.
  c - in the BASIC window, go to the end of the file, and paste this whole text.
  d - save and close. You can now use the macros by Tools menu > Macros > Macro,
        select a macro and click Run.
  e - it is possible to add keyboard shortcuts or buttons to run macros easily in OOo.

USAGE:
  1 - To prepare a file (i.e. segment it into sentences):
  1a - open it in OpenOffice.org.
  1b - if sentences in your SOURCE text are separated by dot-1 space,
        run the Segment1Space macro on your source text.
  1c - if sentences in your SOURCE text are separated by dot-2 spaces,
        run the Segment2Spaces macro on your source text.
  2 - translate your text and compile it.
  3 - To finish a file (i.e. restore the original segmentation):
  3a - open it in OpenOffice.org.
  3b - if you want sentences in your TARGET text to be separated by dot-1 space,
        run the UnSegment1Space macro on your target text.
  3c - if you want sentences in your TARGET text to be separated by dot-2 spaces,
        run the UnSegment2Spaces macro on your target text.
  4 - that's it!
  NOTE: the UnSegment macros might be a bit slow on a big document
  NOTE: OOo's repagination feature can take a while to catch up after running these macros.

Version history:
0.1: (2004/03/06) First release - Benjamin Siband
0.2: (2004/03/06) Cosmetic changes - Benjamin Siband
    - changed the loop's findFirst into findNext
    - cleaned the code from unnecessary structure declarations
0.3: (2004/03/12) Optimization + New function - Benjamin Siband
    - optimization: the common code for the segmentation macros has been extracted into a new procedure
    - new segmentation macro for both 1 and 2 spaces after punctuation (this is for messy texts mixing
       both styles)

Ideas for future development:
- language versions of the macros (esp. for the list of abbr., but also segmentation rules).
       Please provide special requirements.
- read the list of abbreviations from an external file
- auto-installer

***  DISCLAIMER  *****
The author has done some basic testing on these macros, and they seem to work well, for him.
Always keep backups of your files before you run these macros!!!
The author shall not be held responsible is anything goes wrong with the use of these macros.
Testing has been done with OpenOffice.org v. 1.1.0, English version, on Windows XP, English US version.
